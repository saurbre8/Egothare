#### Overview

**Samric** has served as [[Lenora|Lenora's]] herbalist for a long time, in fact longer than most residents even remember. People don't know much about him or his life, just that he enjoys nature more than any type of civilization. He stays away from the main part of town and you can most likely find him in his house a short walk into the woods. 

#### Appearance

The herbalist is of [[Halfling Ancestry]] and is no taller than a meter and is certainly not taller than the walking staff he carries. The staff has an active beehive on the top of it, though the bees never seem to go far from it. his dirty white beard reaches down to his waist, while the hair on the top of his head looks more like a nest than anything else. You would often find **Samric** with a collection of herbs either in a pouch or just stuffed into his pockets.
