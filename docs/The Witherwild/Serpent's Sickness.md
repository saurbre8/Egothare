**Serpent's Sickness** is a disease that originated in [[Haven]] after an ancient dust was disturbed.

----

### Overview

Over the last two years, over half of [[Haven|Haven's]] populace fell to the disease known as the [[Serpent's Sickness]]. The plague sweeping across [[Haven]] spares no one. Since the initial outbreak, [[Haven]] officials have worked tirelessly to quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of crimson [[Lady's Veil]], many citizens began to carry or consume all manner of flowers and shed snake skins in an attempt to protect or cure themselves.

In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. This dust is how the disease spreads. An uninfected individual that breathes in the dust will most likely become infected. Later a scaled rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique and painful pattern that resembles a snake’s skin. Not long after, the victims’ bodies harden until their organs solidify and cease to function. The final stages of the **Serpent’s Sickness** is so quick that many transform into statues where they stand, leaving all of [[Haven]] a cenotaph to a once-great power.

### Origin

In their quest to be free from the influence of the [[Faint Divinities]] that dominated the surrounding regions, the Havenites killed [[Shun'Aush the Granite Orphid]], a mighty [[Faint Divinities|Faint Divinity]]. The remains of [[Shun'Aush the Granite Orphid|Shun'Aush]] remain in the city of [[Haven]] and make up the walls of the city. For centuries, the fine dust left behind from carving the stone body remained undisturbed. That was until the growing population of the city forced farmers to till deeper into the soil and miners to hack into hidden stone. This disturbed the ancient dust and created a virulent plague.
