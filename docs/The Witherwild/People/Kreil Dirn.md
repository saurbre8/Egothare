**Kreil Dirn** (he/him) is [[Haven|Haven's]] beleaguered spymaster.

----

#### Overview

**Kreil** is not a very popular person in [[Haven]]. He is responsible for rooting out insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to start, and keeping a close watch on [[Haven|Haven’s]] internal activities.
**Kreil** has never agreed—at least not openly—with [[Archmage Phylax|Archmage Phylax’s]] decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating.

#### Fanewraith's Plot

Recently, **Kreil** uncovered the [[Fanewraith]]’s plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a troop of [[Haven]] soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the [[Fanewraith]] from stealing the [[Sowing Eye]], **Kreil** uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the [[Fanewraith]] to swift justice.
