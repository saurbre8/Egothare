#### Overview

For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled **Lady's Veil**, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even so, they were only foraged until the Havenites discovered crimson **lady’s veil**—the only known cure for [[Serpent's Sickness]]

Thus, the Haven Army invaded [[Fanewick]] and began cultivating the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the region’s bogs. Though the theft of the Reaping Eye has created an indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare, and [[Fanewick]] is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the Haven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the [[Serpent's Sickness]].
