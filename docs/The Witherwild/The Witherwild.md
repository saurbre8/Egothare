This corruption, empowered by the endless spring, is spreading throughout [[Fanewick]].

----
#### Overview

Some believe the overgrowth began in the forest, while others claim it sprang from the bogs. But no matter its origins, this flourishing malignancy induces horrific changes and massive growth on anything it touches, transforming them into Withered beings. Plants spring to life with a desire to consume all around them. Animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and claws. Even harmless creatures that were once hunted for food have become dangerous and formidable adversaries.

When a person is corrupted by the **Witherwild**, either from a purposeful attack or accidental harm, they are transformed. They become a nightmarish hybrid—their body warped and intertwined with plant or beast. The **Witherwild** slowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same drive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted [[Fanewick]]. Though the Withered may retain a semblance of who they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of their personhood. Some Wicklings believe the Withered are gifted this power by Nikta’s wrath to drive the forces of [[Haven]] from [[Fanewick]] and return the Shepherd’s [[Reaping Eye]].
