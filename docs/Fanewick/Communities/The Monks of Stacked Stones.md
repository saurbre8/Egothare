**The Monks of Stacked Stones** are a [[Community]] of monks that follow [[Fulg, Stacker of Stones]] and run the [[The Stone Flow Baths]].

----

#### Overview

This group of monks show tribute to [[Fulg, Stacker of Stones]] by keeping stones stacked in and around the river that begins in their springs. They are mostly known for their spa, [[The Stone Flow Baths]] where visitors can rest and bathe in their springs. **The Monks of Stacked Stones** are quite peaceful and also are unconcerned with what is happening in the world around them. As long as they and their stones are treated with respect, there should be no problem.

The community is mostly [[Ribbet Ancestry|Ribbets]] and [[Galapa Ancestry|Galapa]], with some other ancestries sprinkled throughout.
