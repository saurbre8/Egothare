----

#### Overview

The tavern is carved into the Rock about 20 feet above the forest floor. It's entrance is right at the end of the main walkway before it splits up into a multitude of other wooden scaffolding and elevators. It's set of large double doors are most always open, welcoming travelers looking for a bed or maybe a horn of the famous mead. 

The inside of the tavern resembles a mine, with wooden support beams running across the ceiling and doorways along with lanterns hanging throughout the place.
