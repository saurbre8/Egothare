A tucked-away village in southern [[Fanewick]] on the underside of a massive, jutting rock formation often referred to by the locals as the Rock.

----

#### Overview

The village of **Lenora** is medium sized, with about half of the residents living within or in homes constructed along the face of the Rock. Wooden walkways run along the face of the Rock, allowing traversal between the various buildings in or on it. The other half of residents live on the forest floor beneath the Rock. There are a collection of homes as well as the quite large market area on the floor. The recent influx of visitors seeking somewhere safe have overwhelmed **Lenora** and there are tents setup on the outside of the village that travelers are temporarily living in.

**Lenora** is pretty diverse, containing a wide variety of species and professions. Before the breakout of [[Serpent's Sickness]], it was mostly inhabited by [[Faun Ancestry|Fauns]], [[Halfling Ancestry|Halflings]], [[Goblin Ancestry|Goblins]], and [[Elf Ancestry|Elves]]. Nowadays, you can find almost every ancestry in the village.

#### Notable Places

[[The Broken Pick]] is the biggest and most popular tavern in **Lenora**. 

#### Important Residents

[[Vellen Thistlehorn]] is the mayor of **Lenora** and is who decided to welcome so many travelers. 

[[Samric Mosswiggle]] is the village's herbalist who keeps to himself.
