#### Background

**Vellen** was born in raised in [[Alula]], but left once he was old enough to train with the [[Feltharion]] in [[Soldon]]. His training taught him to be honorable as well as a damn good swordsman. Upon completing his time in [[Soldon]], **Vellen** traveled [[Fanewick]] helping communities with any combat related issues. Because of this, he is quite well known by the Wicklings. He would sometimes even take jobs in [[Haven]], so he has some connections there. 

After taking an arrow to the knee when fighting some [[Infernis Ancestry|Infernis]] bandits, **Vellen** retired from his work and settled in [[Lenora]]. Not long after growing roots in the town did he become mayor thanks to his fame and natural ability to create connections. The job was quite easy and quiet until the breakout of the [[Serpent's Sickness]] and the proceeding invasion of [[Fanewick]] by [[Haven]].
