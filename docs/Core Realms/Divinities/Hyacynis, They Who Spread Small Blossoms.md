#### Overview

A [[Faint Divinities|Faint Divinity]] and a friend of bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the [[Witherwild]] after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) to immense proportions. Theyâ€™re enjoying this rampant growth and do not see a reason to end it.

#### Appearance

Not many people have ever seen **Hyancyis**, but those who have say they resemble a young woman with a long, flowing dress on. The dress is a glowing orange/yellow and has ribbons extending from it that hover around **Hyancyis**. Their skin is very fair and a tiara with antenna sits atop their head. Bees can often be found around **Hyancyis** but they never sting.
