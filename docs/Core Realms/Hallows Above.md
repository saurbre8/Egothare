The **Hallows Above** are the collection of deific territories that once belonged to the [[Forgotten Gods]] before the [[New Gods]] claimed it at the end of the Earliest Age.

Because this place is closely connected with most other realms, the gods residing here can see and speak with the creatures of the [[Mortal Realm]] without leaving their domain, though those with whom the gods communicate may find their methods strange or obfuscated. There are ways by which the [[New Gods]] can leave the **Hallows Above** to occupy other realms, but in the current age they must always sacrifice something of personal importance to do so. Itâ€™s rumored that this burden was necessitated by their desire to protect the **Hallows** from the [[Forgotten Gods]] should they rise again, as the [[Forgotten Gods]] (or any being from the [[Mortal Realm]]) would also have to forfeit much to enter the **Hallows Above**. These sacrifices have caused some of the great calamities that have befallen the [[Mortal Realm]] in recent millennia.
