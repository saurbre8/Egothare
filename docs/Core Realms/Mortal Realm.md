The **Mortal Realm** is the land, sea, and sky, where mortals live out the entirety of their lives—the plane where the majority of all material beings and objects exist.

Most adventures will likely take place in the Mortal Realm.

Stories say this realm was created by the Forgotten Gods during the Earliest Age and that these immortals traveled between the [[Hallows Above]] and this new plane as easily as waking from a dream. During this time, the gods were familiar to the mortals and acts of divinity were commonplace—be they wonderful or terrifying. When the Forgotten Gods were overthrown by the New Gods, many of these ancient deities were trapped within this plane eternally.

This realm is also occupied by the Faint Divinities, lesser deities created by both the Forgotten and the New Gods to oversee the **Mortal Realm**. Many are considered to be quite capricious, and though their spheres of influence are smaller than the gods who created them, they can greatly influence the lives of mortals.
