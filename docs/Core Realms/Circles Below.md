The **Circles Below** are the collection of lower realms where many of the Forgotten Gods, those who fought the most passionately during the uprising, were banished.

The **Circles Below** are considered places of corruption, destruction, and violence. Stories say this dominion is home to some of the most dangerous creatures in the core realms. Most other planes have safeguards against Fallen who wish to cross from the [[Circles Below]]. Within the [[Mortal Realm]], the use of arcane magic in acts of great evil is said to open a temporary rift between the two planes, allowing Fallen to pass through.
