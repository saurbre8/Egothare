**Ribbets** resemble anthropomorphic frogs with protruding eyes and webbed hands and feet.

----

**Ribbets** have smooth (though sometimes warty) moist skin and eyes positioned on either side of their head. Some have hind legs more than twice the length of their torso, while others have short limbs. No matter their size (which ranges from about 3 feet to 4 Â½ feet), **ribbets** primarily move by hopping. All **ribbets** have webbed appendages, allowing them to swim with ease. Some possess a natural green-and-brown camouflage, while others are vibrantly colored with bold patterns. No matter their appearance, all **ribbets** are born from eggs laid in the water, hatch into tadpoles, and after about 6 to 7 years, grow into amphibians that can move around on land. **Ribbets** live for approximately 100 years.
