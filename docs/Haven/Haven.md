**Haven** was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase “The Godless Gate.” While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of **Haven** wished to be free of the influence of the [[Faint Divinities]] that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as [[Shun’Aush the Granite Ophid]]. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured **Haven’s** dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that **Haven** is known for.
