#### Overview

Prairie Spiders could be pictured as the definition of "hauntingly beautiful." They are the bane of alchemists and physicians, who often suffer their ambushes when they are out harvesting flowers and herbs for their draughts. My recommendation regarding these magnificent beasts is that you learn how to recognize their camouflaged abdomens, and avoid them. 

If that is impossible, fight them from A distance, and use fire. They abhor fire, and will likely flee combat when faced with flames. Just be careful not to burn down the forest to do so, yes?
