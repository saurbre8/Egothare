#### Overview

Mossnoliths are instinctive killers, for their reproductive cycle depends on their murderous capabilities. Despite their comparatively low level of cognition, they have an innate grasp of combat strategy. They will use their rocky appearance to camouflage themselves until the distance is perfect for an ambush. They will make boulders rain upon their targets from a distance. And when the time comes that they must land the final strike, they will be unencumbered by the moral considerations of more advanced lifeforms. A formidable predator.
