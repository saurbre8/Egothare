**Serpent's Sickness** is a disease that originated in [[Haven]] after an ancient dust was disturbed.

### Overview

The plague sweeping across [[Haven]] spares no one. Since the initial outbreak, [[Haven]] officials have worked tirelessly to quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of crimson lady’s veil, many citizens began to carry or consume all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to protect or cure themselves.

In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique and painful pattern that resembles a snake’s skin. Not long after, the victims’ bodies harden until their organs solidify and cease to function. The final stages of the **Serpent’s Sickness** is so quick that many transform into statues where they stand, leaving all of [[Haven]] a cenotaph to a once-great power.
