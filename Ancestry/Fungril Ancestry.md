**Fungril** resemble humanoid mushrooms.

----

**Fungril** can be either more humanoid or more fungal in appearance, and they come in an assortment of colors, from earth tones to bright reds, yellows, purples, and blues. **Fungril** display an incredible variety of bodies, faces, and limbs, as thereâ€™s no single common shape among them. Even their heights range from a tiny 2 feet tall to a staggering 7 feet tall. While the common lifespan of a **fungril** is about 300 years, some have been reported to live much longer. They can communicate nonverbally, and many members of this ancestry use a mycelial array to chemically exchange information with other **fungril** across long distances.

Most **fungril** grow fungus or mushroom caps on their head and body. These caps can grow in a variety of styles-some **fungril** have one cap while others have many. Caps can also be modified or cultivated to grow into particular shapes. **Fungril** caps grow continuously throughout their life, so they often trim or shape them for comfort. As they age, their caps lose stiffness and may begin to sag.
