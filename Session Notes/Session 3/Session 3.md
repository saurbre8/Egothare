#### Recap 
Recap of [[Session 1]]:
Players are in [[Lenora]] when it gets attacked by large bees. They players defeat the bees and chase one into the woods that is carrying a [[Lady's Veil]] (crimson). They follow it to [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]. The [[Faint Divinities||Faint Divinity]] asks them for help but to first find [[Samric Mosswiggle]] to prepare them for the deep overgrown forest.
**Errata**: the players followed the bee a bit into the forest, not the actual overgrowth on the map.

Recap of [[Session 2]]:
The players resume in [[The Broken Pick]], and set out to search for [[Samric Mosswiggle]]. They locate his hut to the east of [[Lenora]] and find it abandoned. Door wide open, looks rushed. There is a note, [[Samric Note]] that explains he must return to the hives in order to help with the bees. 
Next, the players head back to [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]. They are told to head to the overgrowth in the northeast. It is a two day hike.
The players stop after one day of traveling at [[The Stone Flow Baths]] and they learn of the issue of the cooling baths, [[Q1 - Stone Baths Cooling]]. They decide to help and defeat the witch in the caves. Awarded free spa forever there. Players end the session at the baths, looking to go forward towards the overgrowth. 

#### Searching for the Beehive
Players must search for the beehive in the overgrowth. Make a dungeon using the Wyrd Wyld book.
