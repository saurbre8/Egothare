#### Recap 
Recap of [[Session 1]]:
Players are in [[Lenora]] when it gets attacked by large bees. They players defeat the bees and chase one into the woods that is carrying a [[Lady's Veil]] (crimson). They follow it to [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]. The [[Faint Divinities||Faint Divinity]] asks them for help but to first find [[Samric Mosswiggle]] to prepare them for the deep overgrown forest.
**Errata**: the players followed the bee a bit into the forest, not the actual overgrowth on the map.

Recap of [[Session 2]]:
The players resume in [[The Broken Pick]], and set out to search for [[Samric Mosswiggle]]. They locate his hut to the east of [[Lenora]] and find it abandoned. Door wide open, looks rushed. There is a note, [[Samric Note]] that explains he must return to the hives in order to help with the bees. 
Next, the players head back to [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]. They are told to head to the overgrowth in the northeast. It is a two day hike.
The players stop after one day of traveling at [[The Stone Flow Baths]] and they learn of the issue of the cooling baths, [[Q1 - Stone Baths Cooling]]. They decide to help and defeat the witch in the caves. Awarded free spa forever there. Players end the session at the baths, looking to go forward towards the overgrowth. 

#### Searching for the Beehive
Point crawl. 
##### Point A - Entrance
The plants start to grow gradually, the path becomes more overgrown and harder to follow. 

##### Point B - Snail Blockage
A large snail blocks the path. He has no interest in moving from his spot, completely blocking the path. Giving the snail food can convince him to leave, he also likes shiny things. He likes fungus and decaying plants. 

 Options for clearing the snail:
 - Players can forage the area and get some mushrooms to give to him. 
 - Players can give it something shiny. 
 - Players can murder it and climb over.

##### Point C - Blooming Basin
Lack of trees, but a bunch of car sized flowers are around the road, used to be a clearing. As the players walk along, they come across two moth like [[Faerie Ancestry]] fighting. 
A figure, standing taller than most giants even, with snow white wings tipped with crimson. It's dark metal armor contrasts its white fur. It spins through the sky, striking with it's large sword like a drill into a slightly smaller, furry and brown moth faerie, knocking him back. The smaller one blocks the attack with his shield, but stumbles back and falls. The white one leaps up, flapping its wings before coming down, its sword leading, going right through the shield of the brown one, and going through its body. A look of shock washes over their face, before the life drains from their eyes. 
The winning moth bows after pulling his sword from the lifeless moth on the ground. 
Honorable knight named Ser Firiwen of The Verdant Maw. He is the Rittermonte of the area, protecting it and serving. The other Rittermonte was trying to challenge him for his territory. 
Keep honor and knightliness in mind. Doesn't fight players but warns them to not cause trouble.

##### Point D - Abandoned Haven Carts
A few carts line the side of the road, completely empty. Multiple Haven soldiers lay dead around the carts. There is one behind a cart, decayed and stinking. Bugs swarm the body. There are also strewn about cages, some covered with canvas. If uncovered a decaying bee can be inside. 
It's unclear how they died, no visible wounds or anything, vultures have been pecking away at the bodies however.

If players search the carts, they can find:
- Saddlebag, where letter and map are found, and can have 5 coins and molded bread in it. 
	- A map of The Verdent Maw, showing a scribble of a few buildings labeled "Verdant Hollow" and then a terribly drawn bee a bit past it. There isn't much else on the map, the roads going through the forest, with some notes here and there. 
	- A letter a soldier wrote that never made it back to the family it was written to. It says "Dear Anstaria, I don't know when I will make it home next. Something is being organized that will have me heading further into the wild. I won't just be dealing with animals anymore, they need everyone they have. If I don't make it home make sure the kids know I love them and I didn't abandon them." The letter is signed by a Hundrem.
- Some broken and full barrels of a blue liquid, quite viscous. Dylan Recognizes it as the salve he found at Samric's house
- Searching the bodies gives a rusting shortsword and gambeson armor. 

##### Point E - Briar Patch
A large growth of oversized briars envelops the path. The thorns the size of daggers. 
Agility roll to go through (20), taking damage if not passing and not getting through.
Too many to hack away at them, burning could cause a forest fire. 
Try to make them go back. 

#### Point F - Verdant Hollow
An abandoned and overgrown small town. There is a few buildings scattered in close proximity, now have vines and mushrooms covering and growing from the roofs.
