If they talk to the mayor, [[Vellen Thistlehorn]], have him say he doesnt trust Samric. He provides gear to the squad. Some weak venom, a handful of coins to each player. 
"The plants in that region have a mind of their own, be careful and don't trust even the smallest weed."
"We need him right now. Many people are hurt after the attack and he is our best healer. Do you think you can help find him..?"
If they come to him with knowledge of note, he can get mad and tell the characters he will repay them if they help him. 

If they ask bartender at the Broken Pick, He says yeah, Samric lives on the east side of town out towards the lake. He's never been there himself, as hes a *clank* lol doesnt need the help of a herbalist often. 

If they find someone else in the bar 

Once the players look into Samric, they will find his house empty. 
SAMRIC'S HOUSE SEARCH CHECKS
- PC can make an instinct role (13) to identify clues in the room. 
	- On a success, there's a note that is signed by a Berold Goodheart. Then Ethan makes a Knowledge Roll (15), if success then he remembers that name. It's a commander in the Haven Army. If with fear, don't give them complete knowledge of the contents, On hope, give them note contents [[Samric Note]]
	- On fail, find the note, torn and only the name there. Notice how they appeared to have left quicky. 
	- Can add some potions: [[Loot]]
