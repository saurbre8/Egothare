Recap of [[Session 1]]:
Players are in [[Lenora]] when it gets attacked by large bees. They players defeat the bees and chase one into the woods that is carrying a [[Lady's Veil]] (crimson). They follow it to [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]. The [[Faint Divinities||Faint Divinity]] asks them for help but to first find [[Samric Mosswiggle]] to prepare them for the deep overgrown forest.
**Errata**: the players followed the bee a bit into the forest, not the actual overgrowth on the map.

##### Searching for Samric
If they talk to the mayor, [[Vellen Thistlehorn]], have him say they need Samric rn and hes lost. He provides gear to the squad. A handful of coins to each player, a day's worth of jerky for each player. 
"The plants in that region have a mind of their own, be careful and don't trust even the smallest weed."
"We need him right now. Many people are hurt after the attack and he is our best healer. Do you think you can help find him..?"
If they come to him with knowledge of note, he can get mad and tell the characters he will repay them if they help him. 

If they ask bartender at the Broken Pick, He says yeah, Samric lives on the east side of town out towards the lake. He's never been there himself, as hes a *clank* lol doesnt need the help of a herbalist often. 

If they find someone else in the bar, have them say similar things to the bartender. Just that he lives on the east side of town. 

Someone could mention that the mayor [[Vellen Thistlehorn]] is looking for them, as they fought so well in the battle in Lenora.

Once the players look into Samric, they will find his house empty. 
SAMRIC'S HOUSE SEARCH CHECKS
- PC can make an instinct role (13) to identify clues in the room. 
	- On a success, there's a note that is signed by a Berold Goodheart. Then Ethan makes a Knowledge Roll (15), if success then he remembers that name. It's a commander in the Haven Army. If with fear, don't give them complete knowledge of the contents, On hope, give them note contents [[Samric Note]]
	- On fail, find the note, torn and only the name there. Notice how they appeared to have left quicky. 
	- Can add some potions: [[Loot]], Bee Repellant Salve (advantage against bees for 1 hour)

Back to [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]. They get guidance to go rescue the bees. If they free the bees they will be rewarded. 
- Tells them she has tracked the angry swarm to the large overgrowth to the north. Its about two days travel walking. The [[The Stone Flow Baths]] are a days hike, so could be a good stopping point (she doesnt say so maybe). 

##### Players will probably leave to go back to the hive at some point. 
* Tracking the Haven soldiers: Instinct roll (11) to find the paths that the Haven soldiers use. Boot prints in dirt on these trails and lead to camp. 
* FIGHTS HERE: 
	- Haven soldiers outside the area, S2.01 Combat:
		There is destroyed tents and empty cages around. Some soldiers are cleaning up the area. Not many left to be guarding the area. 
	* Players can run into soldiers capturing bees with nets. That is S2.02, no map
	* Hive / Capture Site: A huge beehive on the ground with a destroyed building and tents. 
		* Players can hear arguing inside the tent. Upon pulling up, Samric is inside with a Haven forester/herbalist/scientist. They are arguing about the mad bees and how Samric failed to calm them. Inside there are needles and a tank of some sort of liquid for calming the bees down.
		  The Haven man is a elf with long brown hair and is not scared of the players but isn't trying to fight them.
		Samric explains that the Haven army is capturing the bees for the fields. They pollinate the [[Lady's Veil]] and help it grow. They believe that it will possibly create a greater number of crimson ones. He has been helping them calm the bees with his salve. 
		They were trying to calm and take the queen bee when the bees went crazy and attacked and broke out of the hive.
		Motions towards the hive and the broken side of the wall when talking about queen.

Ideas: 
Players can help sabotage the camp. They can explore the hive and get jumped by a muscle bee defending the dying queen. This hive is toast but its a bigger operation, that's why the elf is talking to Samric. 

Maybe Samric asks for the players to stop the larger operation. He doesn't have knowledge of other camps though. (maybe a spy??). Desperate to get his wife Marsha back from the fields.

If the players let the elf go, he tells Haven about the party. They will be recognized by some forces now. 


##### After Haven Camp
Players return to [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]] after completing the tasks, she thanks them and gives them what they asked for. 
Draedon: Information about the group in [[Fire's Shadow]]. Points him to rock that is the shape of a sword hilt. Blooming Execution.

Hopper: Locket of the  Swarm. Shrubbler, tie it in somehow

Bobo: seed for seeking knowledge 

**The Locket of the Swarm**
**Appearance**: A **bronze locket** shaped like a honeycomb. Inside: a **single bee** preserved in amber.
**Activation**: Press the latch—the locket opens up and a flower blooms inside, attracting a **swarm of bees**.

**Blooming Execution**:
**Appearance**: A **small, ornate vial** of shimmering crimson liquid, swirling with tiny petals. Can be applied to a weapon to give the effect: 
On a critical hit, spend 1 Hope. Effect: The target’s wound bursts into flowering vines (separate 2d6 damage). When the target dies, their body becomes a garden—a Lady’s Veil grows from their heart. Roll a d100, on a 100, it is crimson.
Can be refilled by combining a crimson Lady's Veil and boiling honey in the vial.

**Eden's Garden**: 
A seed that slowly grows into a book that allows for a new spell. When you enter a place of **great magical or spiritual significance**, the seed begins to buzz faintly.

Players return to [[Vellen Thistlehorn]] with/without [[Samric Mosswiggle]]. 
- [[Lenora]] remembers them, friends of the town now.
- 15 coins each, points them to job board if they are looking for more work.
