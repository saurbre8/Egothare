## Scenes
#### Opening
The players are in [[Lenora]]. [[Draedon Frostfire]] sits in [[The Broken Pick]], *let ethan decide what hes doing*
[[Hopper]] is walking through the busy market stalls on the ground, looking to find some food.
[[Bobo Bananarama]] seeks out the [[Lenora]] mayor [[Vellen Thistlehorn]] to try and locate someone who might have knowledge of the [[Librum Mysticorum]]. He has heard the stories of Vellen and knows he has traveled far and wide across Fanewick. He waits in the town hall for the mayor Vellen. 

#### Combat in the market
While collected in [[Lenora]], large bees attack! Session 1.1 Combat [Link](https://freshcutgrass.app/)
- Start while Bobo is waiting for the mayor in the town hall, which is bottom of rock.
- Hopper see's people get killed by the bees and gets ready to fight
- Draedon hears the commotion and exits the bar.
They all rush out to fight and are in the city center. 
Bobo and Draedon come from the left side, Hopper is already in the market and prepares to fight.
Massive bees, some a foot long and some even bigger, Many have abnormally large stingers or too many wings. 

Once fight is over, a bee holding a crimson [[Lady's Veil]] stops by the players. It flies away but turns around almost like a dog asking them to follow. 
Hopper is in seek of a sign after Elder Shrubbler told him to go to Lenora in search of one.
Bobo knows a crimson ladys veil could help him trade for knowledge
Draedon is just retard idk. maybe he can help his mom's group if they get a flower

#### Following Bee
If players follow, take them through the forest headed towards [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]. 

After following for a bit, the players arrive at a overgrowth of plants. Massive flowers and plants are everywhere. As they approach the jungle of overgrown plants, they notice there appears to have been a fight or battle just inside the growth. 

OVERGROWTH ENVIRONMENT CHECKS
- PC can make an **Instinct** (11) role to identify evidence of the fight
	- On a hope success, they get three of the information.
	- On a fear success, two info 
	- On fail, learn one and can mark a Stress to gain advantage on a second roll.
- Three pieces of info:
	- Scorch marks on a nearby plant
	- Chopped off vines litter the ground
	- A dropped dagger, with the Haven Armies Insignia
**Action**: Target must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll (11) or take 1d8+3 physical damage and become Restrained by barbed vines. Restrained creatures until theyâ€™re freed by dealing at least 6 damage to the vines.

After the environment, the bee peeks out from the giant plants and the players notice them. Keep following. They are lead to a large pink flower that is a bud. the flower opens and [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]] is inside. A swarm of bees surround the players and the plants around them start to shift

- Hyacynis dialogue
	- "It's ok my children, *these* ones aren't from Haven. In fact, they are here to help."
	- *the bees chill out and many fly away*
	- "I see you seek crimson lady's veil. As a friend of flowers I can certainly find you more of those.... The bees did they hurt you?"
	- pcs
	- *express sorry for whatever they say*
	- "My poor bees are angry and are venturing way too far from their hives! I need your help. Of course there's much in it for you, I am a *divinity*."
	- pcs
	- *if they accept* "I implore you not to wander into my garden without further knowledge and preparedness however. Go to [[Lenora]], seek the herbalist [[Samric Mosswiggle]], he should be able to help you prepare to reach the hives further in the growth. If you come back here I will assume you hope to help me."

#### After Hyacynis
The players should head back to [[Lenora]]. If not, improv. Here are some example encounters:

An ambush in the forest by some angry and hungry bears: S1.01 [Link](https://freshcutgrass.app/) 
- This happened, players save the bear. it runs off, they don't kill one of its parents

Roots that start attacking the players: S1.02

Haven guards that are defending something: S1.03

Once the players look into Samric, they will find his house empty. 
SAMRIC'S HOUSE SEARCH CHECKS
- PC can make an instinct role (13) to identify clues in the room. 
	- On a success, there's a note that is signed by a Berold Goodheart. Then Ethan makes a Knowledge Roll (15), if success then he remembers that name. It's a commander in the Haven Army. If with fear, don't give them complete knowledge of the contents, maybe its ripped or otherwise. On hope, give them note contents [[Samric Note]]
	- On fail, dont find the note, instead just notice how they appeared to have left quicky. 
	- Can add some potions: [[Loot]]

If they talk to the mayor, [[Vellen Thistlehorn]], have him say he doesnt trust Samric. He provides gear to the squad. Some weak venom, a handful of coins to each player. 
"The plants in that region have a mind of their own, be careful and don't trust even the smallest weed."
"I don't trust Samric but we need him right now. Many people are hurt after the attack and he is our best healer. Do you think you can help find him..?"
If they come to him with knowledge of note, he can get mad and tell the characters he will repay them if they help him. 

### Go back to the overgrowth



## Notes from session
players are wondering why haven is in the forest
curious of the deity.

gaining trust of each other.

betting game at tavern after getting back. 

8 FEAR

their next goal is to find the druid. 
- Ethan should have an idea of the area of druid or know who to ask. Maybe he knows the direction out of town or the mayor to ask.
