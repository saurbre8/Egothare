Getting this quest: The players must visit the [[The Stone Flow Baths]] and speak to a [[The Monks of Stacked Stones]] there.

----

[[The Stone Flow Baths]] are cooling and the monks do not know why. They ask for help discovering the source, and have reported glowing roots breaching the bottom of the baths and sapping water and heat. 

The players need to look around the area. Without asking for the map or any information on the surrounding area, players look around with an Instinct roll (15). 
- Success with Hope: players instantly find the cave mouth. it is not covered with vines and they can go in
- Success with Fear: they find the cave but it is covered with vines and a Strength (13) roll or fire magic roll of the same difficulty in order to clear them. 
- Failure with Hope: The players find a dead deer that is being wrapped by the glowing vines. The vines appear to be pulsing, almost like draining the deer. The roots lead off into the forest. Takes a quarter day to keep looking.
- Failure with Fear: Ground caves in, fall into a cave. Take 1hp of damage and alerts the witch, they will have first move in combat. The vines pulse with glowing energy, heading further into the cave. 

##### Inside the cave
Count-up to 4. Cave resembles a serpent's guts with glowing roots running along the walls. 
	1. Split paths, one left and one right. Instinct roll (15): on a success, go the right way, countdown increases. On fail, dead end, come back and the vines have grown over the other entrance. Need a strength roll of 13 or magic fire. With hope, give them that there is a puddle of water at the end of the dead end.
	2. Collapsed section, a hole in the floor is collapsed and goes down about 15 feet. It seems to lead into another part of the cave but you aren't sure. Depending on the actions, make a roll. Prob Agility to clear the jump (10). 
	3. Flooded section: Agility (13) to swim through. Hopper will prob go first, if success with hope, root covered hole at bottom of flooded section could drain it. If someone fails to swim, take a stress and have to turn around. 
	4. Steam vents: Come into wider part of the tunnels, let players be creative with handling it and make a roll or downside. 

Getting through countdown: Players should be beat-up and ready for a fight. 
Come into a room after the steam vents that has a witch hunchbacked by a large plant-like chamber holding a body inside and a liquid. Depending on past events, maybe witch is not in sight, hiding from them and will jump them. 
Players fight: Q1.01, witch cursing and pod with glowing roots attacking. Style the acid attacks as the hot water from the pod.
